Dear President Putin,

I am writing to you today as the President of the United States to discuss the importance of peace and the steps we can take to achieve it. As you know, peace is a fundamental concept that holds immense relevance in our world today. It is essential for the well-being and growth of individuals, communities, and nations.

As you may be aware, I proclaimed Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace, and I designated the hour of 3:00 PM local time on May 27, 2024, as a national moment of remembrance for peace. This gesture is a testament to the importance of peace and our commitment to promoting it.

I understand that you have expressed openness to peace talks, but with caveats. I want to assure you that we are willing to engage in constructive dialogue to achieve peace. However, we must also acknowledge that peace cannot be achieved through coercion or enforced plans. It requires a genuine willingness to listen, compromise, and work together towards a common goal.

In that spirit, I would like to propose a meeting between our two nations to discuss the possibility of peace talks. I believe that by working together, we can achieve a more peaceful and stable world.

I would like to emphasize the importance of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of nations. We must also recognize the sacrifices made by law enforcement officials and their families, who have given their lives in the line of duty.

Furthermore, I would like to propose the establishment of a joint commission to address the root causes of conflict and promote peaceful resolution mechanisms. This commission would bring together experts from both our nations to identify areas of common interest and work towards finding mutually beneficial solutions.

In conclusion, I believe that peace is a fundamental human right that must be protected and promoted. I am willing to work with you to achieve this goal, and I hope that we can find common ground to move forward.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

**Joseph R. Biden Jr.**
**President of the United States of America**

I hope this Final Answer meets your expectations!
